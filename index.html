			<p>Concentration, also known as Match Match, Memory, Pelmanism, Shinkei-suijaku, Pexeso or simply Pairs, is a card game in which all of the cards are laid face down on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn. If the pair is a match (for example, two red queens or two black kings), proceed to the next turn. The object of the game is to pair all the matching cards.</p>
